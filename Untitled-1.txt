        Here is a little background on my family.  My Name is Brian.  
        Im married to my wonderful wife Allion.  Together we have five children.
        Henry is our oldest.  He is ten years old.  Next is June.  She is eight.  Next
        is George.  He is five.  Then there's Fred.  He is three.  Finally we have Frances.
        She was born August 22 this year.  Its a huge blessing having them all in my life.
        We're blessed to have so much youth in our home.  It really does keep you feeling
        young and ALWAYS moving!  I came from a very small family, but had lots of friends
        with larger families that i always like being around.  I guess you could say i'm living
        the dream.

        Things i like doing are cooking, running for cardio, planning vacations (with the hope
        we'll get to take one), and playing games with the family.  Cooking has always been hobby till
        one day it became my livelyhood.  I've done everything.  Hot food, cold food, baking and pastry, 
        small dinners, large multicourse dinners, vasts buffets, and some magic type stuff like ice carvings
        and fancy dessert sculptures (not really meant to eat).

        I'd love to learn more about DIY autocraft so that i might buy an RV or trailer and 
        see the entire United States with my wife and kids.  I've seen some youtube videos of people
        who have sold their homes and bought a home on wheels.  I dont know if thats for me, but it might 
        be very fun to try for a week or two.  If we owned our own i'd definitely be open to some
        custom work to make it a great fit for my family.
